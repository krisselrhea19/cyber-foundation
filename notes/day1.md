   - 'dirb' tool -> To find hidden URLs

   - Careers include - Security Analyst, Security Engineer, Incident Responser, Digital Forensics Examiner(detective kinda work, sounds interesting), Malware Analyst(requires strong coding skills), Penetration Tester(also called Ethical Hacking), Red Teamer

3. Ran network commands:
   - ping - sends ICMP echo requests to a host to check if it's reachable and measures round‑trip time (latency).  
   - traceroute - shows the path packets take from your machine to the destination; lists each hop (router) and latency to that hop. Useful to see number of network hops and where delays happen.  
   - dig (DNS lookup tool) — queries DNS servers for records (A, AAAA, MX, etc.). Good for seeing which IP(s) a domain resolves to and which DNS server answered.

- Captured HTTP GET request in Wireshark
